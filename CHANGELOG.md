# Changelog

## Upcoming version

### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
- [[#279](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/279)] Remove restriction from `read_volatile_from` and `write_volatile_into`
  that made it copy data it chunks of 4096.

### Removed
### Deprecated

## [v0.14.0]

### Added
- [[#266](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/266)] Derive `Debug` for several
  types that were missing it.

### Changed
- [[#274](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/274)] Drop `Default` as requirement for `ByteValued`.

## [v0.13.1]

### Added

- [[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `std::io::Stdout`.
- [[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `std::vec::Vec`.
- [[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `Cursor<&mut [u8]>`.
- [[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)] Implement `ReadVolatile`
  for `Cursor<T: AsRef[u8]>`.

## [v0.13.0]

### Added
- [[#247]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/247) Add `ReadVolatile` and
  `WriteVolatile` traits which are equivalents of `Read`/`Write` with volatile
  access semantics.

### Changed

- [[#247]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/247) Deprecate
  `Bytes::{read_from, read_exact_from, write_to, write_all_to}`. Instead use
  `ReadVolatile`/`WriteVolatile`, which do not incur the performance penalty
  of copying to hypervisor memory due to `Read`/`Write` being incompatible
  with volatile semantics (see also #217).


## [v0.12.2]

### Fixed
- [[#251]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/251): Inserted checks
  that verify that the value returned by `VolatileMemory::get_slice` is of
  the correct length.

### Deprecated
- [[#244]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/241) Deprecate volatile
  memory's `as_ptr()` interfaces. The new interfaces to be used instead are:
  `ptr_guard()` and `ptr_guard_mut()`.

## [v0.12.1]

### Fixed
- [[#241]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/245) mmap_xen: Don't drop
  the FileOffset while in use #245

## [v0.12.0]

### Added
- [[#241]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/241) Add Xen memory
  mapping support: Foreign and Grant. Add new API for accessing pointers to
  volatile slices, as `as_ptr()` can't be used with Xen's Grant mapping.
- [[#237]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/237) Implement `ByteValued` for `i/u128`.

## [v0.11.0]

### Added
- [[#216]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/216) Add `GuestRegionMmap::from_region`.

### Fixed
- [[#217]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/217) Fix vm-memory internally
  taking rust-style slices to guest memory in ways that could potentially cause 
  undefined behavior. Removes/deprecates various `as_slice`/`as_slice_mut` methods
  whose usage violated rust's aliasing rules, as well as an unsound 
  `impl<'a> VolatileMemory for &'a mut [u8]`.

## [v0.10.0]

### Changed
