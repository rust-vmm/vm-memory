# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed

## \[v0.17.0\]

### Added

- \[[#311](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/311)\] Allow compiling without the ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile implementations

### Changed

- \[[#307](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/304)\] Move `read_volatile_from`, `read_exact_volatile_from`,
  `write_volatile_to` and `write_all_volatile_to` functions from the `GuestMemory` trait to the `Bytes` trait.

- \[#324](https:////github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/324)\] `GuestMemoryRegion::bitmap()` now returns a `BitmapSlice`. Accessing the full bitmap is now possible only if the type of the memory region is know, for example with `MmapRegion::bitmap()`.

### Removed

- \[[#307](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/304)\] Remove deprecated functions `Bytes::read_from`, `Bytes::read_exact_from`,
  `Bytes::write_to`, `Bytes::write_all_to`, `GuestMemory::as_slice`, `GuestMemory::as_slice_mut`, `GuestMemory::with_regions`, 
  `GuestMemory::with_regions_mut`, `GuestMemory::map_and_fold`, `VolatileSlice::as_ptr`, `VolatileRef::as_ptr`, and
  `VolatileArrayRef::as_ptr`.
- \[[#320](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/320)\] Drop `check_file_offset` check when using  `MmapRegionBuilder`.
  The `mmap(2)` syscall itself already validates that offset and length are valid, and trying to replicate this check
  in userspace ended up being imperfect.

## \[v0.16.1\]

### Added

- \[[#304](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/304)\] Implement ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile for TcpStream

## \[v0.16.0\]

### Added

- \[[#287](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/287)\] Support for RISC-V 64-bit platform.
- \[[#299](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/299)\] atomic_bitmap: support enlarging the bitmap.

### Changed

- \[[#278](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/278) Remove `GuestMemoryIterator` trait,
  and instead have GuestMemory::iter() return `impl Iterator`.

## \[v0.15.0\]

### Added

- \[[#270](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/270)\] atomic_bitmap: add capability to reset bits range
- \[[#285](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/285)\] Annotated modules in lib.rs to indicate their feature
  dependencies such that it is reflected in the docs, enhancing documentation clarity for users.

### Changed

- \[[#275](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/275)\] Fail builds on non 64-bit platforms.

### Fixed

- \[[#279](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/279)\] Remove restriction from `read_volatile_from` and `write_volatile_into`
  that made it copy data it chunks of 4096.

### Removed

### Deprecated

## \[v0.14.0\]

### Added

- \[[#266](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/266)\] Derive `Debug` for several
  types that were missing it.

### Changed

- \[[#274](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/274)\] Drop `Default` as requirement for `ByteValued`.

## \[v0.13.1\]

### Added

- \[[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)\] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `std::io::Stdout`.
- \[[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)\] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `std::vec::Vec`.
- \[[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)\] Implement `WriteVolatile`
  for `Cursor<&mut [u8]>`.
- \[[#256](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/256)\] Implement `ReadVolatile`
  for `Cursor<T: AsRef[u8]>`.

## \[v0.13.0\]

### Added

- [\[#247\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/247) Add `ReadVolatile` and
  `WriteVolatile` traits which are equivalents of `Read`/`Write` with volatile
  access semantics.

### Changed

- [\[#247\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/247) Deprecate
  `Bytes::{read_from, read_exact_from, write_to, write_all_to}`. Instead use
  `ReadVolatile`/`WriteVolatile`, which do not incur the performance penalty
  of copying to hypervisor memory due to `Read`/`Write` being incompatible
  with volatile semantics (see also #217).

## \[v0.12.2\]

### Fixed

- [\[#251\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/251): Inserted checks
  that verify that the value returned by `VolatileMemory::get_slice` is of
  the correct length.

### Deprecated

- [\[#244\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/241) Deprecate volatile
  memory's `as_ptr()` interfaces. The new interfaces to be used instead are:
  `ptr_guard()` and `ptr_guard_mut()`.

## \[v0.12.1\]

### Fixed

- [\[#241\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/245) mmap_xen: Don't drop
  the FileOffset while in use #245

## \[v0.12.0\]

### Added

- [\[#241\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/241) Add Xen memory
  mapping support: Foreign and Grant. Add new API for accessing pointers to
  volatile slices, as `as_ptr()` can't be used with Xen's Grant mapping.
- [\[#237\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/237) Implement `ByteValued` for `i/u128`.

## \[v0.11.0\]

### Added

- [\[#216\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/216) Add `GuestRegionMmap::from_region`.

### Fixed

- [\[#217\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/217) Fix vm-memory internally
  taking rust-style slices to guest memory in ways that could potentially cause
  undefined behavior. Removes/deprecates various `as_slice`/`as_slice_mut` methods
  whose usage violated rust's aliasing rules, as well as an unsound
  `impl<'a> VolatileMemory for &'a mut [u8]`.

## \[v0.10.0\]

### Changed

- [\[#208\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/issues/208) Updated
  vmm-sys-util dependency to v0.11.0
- [\[#203\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/203) Switched to Rust
  edition 2021.

## \[v0.9.0\]

### Fixed

- [\[#195\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/issues/195):
  `mmap::check_file_offset` is doing the correct size validation for block and
  char devices as well.

### Changed

  bit atomics on ppc64le and s390x.
- [\[#200\]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/200): docs: enable all
